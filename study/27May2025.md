1)  what are pollyfills?
Ans)Polyfill is a piece of code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not nativrly support it.

Example 
let a=[1,2,3,4]

Array.prototype.KishorMap=function(callBack){
    let a=[]
    for (let i=0;i< this.length;i++){
       
        a.push(callBack(this[i]))
    }
    
    return a
}


console.log(a.KishorMap((a)=>a*2))

ex.array includes doesnot exist in internet explorer


2)What is callback hell and avoid it?
Ans.The phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple callbacks within a function is called a callback hell.The shape of the resulting code structure resembles a pyramid and hence callbacks hell is also called as pyramid of doom
 Methods to avoid it
 Promisess
 Async await
modularizing code
us elibrary like asyc.js
